# Snapshot: AGI-Walker v3.0 (Alpha Release)

**Date**: Pre-Jan 2026
**Focus**: AI Chip Integration (IMC-22)

## Description
This version focused on integrating the custom IMC-22 Neural Processing Unit. It established the workflow for quantization and deployment of small control policies.

## Key Components
*   **models/imc22_control_net.py**: defined the 300-byte LSTM network.
*   **tools/imc22_quantizer.py**: converted FP32 weights to INT8.
*   **python_api/batch_generator.py**: generated the initial datasets for supervised learning.

## Limitations
*   RL was limited to basic PPO without automated loops.
*   No Sim2Real handling; simulation was assumed to be perfect.
*   Single robot morphology only (Biped).
